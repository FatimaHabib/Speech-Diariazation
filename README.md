# Speech-Diariazation
Speaker diarization is the task of labelling segments of a long audio recording according to thespeaker information. This work investigates the speaker diarization in the presence of differentacoustic environments. In this report, we have used DIHARD II dataset to analyze speaker di-arization performance for eleven different acoustic environments or scenes. We first introduced thebasic concepts of speaker diarization and we reported the preliminary results in terms ofdiariza-tion error rate(DER),Jaccard error rate(JER). Our preliminary results indicate that the speakerdiarization performance can be substantially improved for several acoustic classes given that theacoustic condition is known apriori. We investigate two methods for categorizing the acoustic class.We explore supervised K-nearest neighbors and unsupersived K-means clustering on the DIHARDII challenge dataset. The results showed that applying a new classification to the data resulted inbetter diarization performance, with the best obtained with the K-mean method.
